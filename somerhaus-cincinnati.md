# A Cincinnati Event Space With a Pulse: Somerhaus in Over‑the‑Rhine

Walk into [Somerhaus](https://somerhaus.space/) and you don't get a generic ballroom. You get a 3,080‑square‑foot former garage with a long skylight, exposed brick, a roll‑up door, and just enough industrial grit to give your celebration a backbone. This [industrial‑chic event space](https://somerhaus.space/) sits on Republic Street in Cincinnati's Over‑the‑Rhine (OTR), a block off Washington Park and a short walk from Vine. It's a venue with a point of view—and that's exactly the point.

## What the room does that most rooms don’t

Scale and light. Somerhaus feels open but not echoey. The central skylight throws natural light across concrete floors, ivy‑lined walls, and steel rafters, so ceremonies don’t need heavy décor and daytime off‑sites don’t feel like they’re in storage. Capacity is honest: up to 130 for a cocktail format, ~80 seated at dinner tables (with those tables and chairs already on site). The result is a space that flexes without losing character.

## Real infrastructure, not wishful thinking

The venue reads “design‑led,” but it works like a production space. Notable features include:

- Two ADA restrooms
- Built‑in bar with commercial ice, glasswasher, two stations, and ample refrigeration
- Prep kitchen (fridge‑freezer, induction burner, microwave, stainless work surfaces) designed for caterer finishing
- Gig‑speed Wi‑Fi
- House sound with Bluetooth and two wireless mics
- Ceiling‑mounted full‑color LED lighting
- Optional projector and screen
- Four 65" AirPlay/Chromecast‑enabled displays
- Six lounge vignettes and six high‑top cocktail tables
- 70 ceremony chairs
- Ground‑level roll‑up door for fast vendor load‑in

The soft stuff is covered, too: long access periods, professional cleaning, an on‑site coordinator, and flexible payment schedules.

## The layouts that actually work

Instead of "one big rectangle," [Somerhaus venue layouts and specs](https://somerhaus.space/venue-details/) include tested configurations:

- **Banquet:** 70–80 seated (6 long tables)
- **California:** 80 seated (8 tables)
- **Dance Floor:** 52–68 seated + a real dance area
- **Lecture Hall:** 64 seated (8 tables)
- **Community:** 48 at one long table
- **Hearth:** 28–36 for intimate dinners

Pick the plan that fits your run‑of‑show and adjacencies (bar, DJ, head table) instead of forcing your program to fit the furniture. A floor plan download is available.

## Weddings: ceremony energy without ceremony hassle

If your sweet spot is 20–80 guests, this [Cincinnati wedding venue in Over‑the‑Rhine](https://somerhaus.space/wedding-venue-cincinnati) feels full without feeling cramped—ideal for micro‑weddings and "just the right size" receptions. A simple arbor with greenery lives on site for ceremony framing; the team flips the room for dinner and dancing without losing time or momentum. You can keep ceremony and reception in the same address and keep your transportation budget at zero.

[Transparent event pricing](https://somerhaus.space/venue-details/pricing/) (as of November 2025): off‑peak wedding packages from **$3,500 (Sun–Thu)**, **$4,500 (Fri)**, and **$5,000 (Sat)**, each with a transparent bar minimum. Bar packages run **$25 / $35 / $45 per guest** across three tiers; add a welcome Champagne or a "Margarita Three Ways" signature for **$5 per guest**. If you care about controlling spend without gutting the experience, this kind of clarity matters.

## Corporate off‑sites that don't feel corporate

For teams that want a working session with actual focus (and a space that looks like you thought about it), this [corporate event venue in Cincinnati](https://somerhaus.space/corporate-events-cincinnati) offers half‑day and full‑day corporate rates with the AV already handled. Use the 65" displays for all‑hands, park stakeholders at long tables for working blocks, then flip to a mixer without moving buildings. The neighborhood handles coffee before and cocktails after.

- **Half‑day:** $1,000
- **Full day (8 a.m.–5 p.m.):** $1,900

## Parties & milestone dinners

Birthdays, showers, rehearsal dinners, retirements: the room balances “special” with “comfortable.”

- **Evening party package:** $1,500 for five hours (5–11 p.m.) with a $500 bar minimum
- **Half day (daytime):** $1,500
- **Full day:** $2,500

The built‑in bar means fewer rentals; the lounge groupings keep mingling natural.

## Bring your vendor team—or borrow theirs

Somerhaus is vendor‑friendly: bring any licensed caterer you trust, or pick from a vetted list that knows the room’s load‑in, plating pathway, and service cadence. That shortens the learning curve and protects your timeline.

## The OTR advantage (walkability and logistics)

Guests don’t have to guess about parking. Nearby options include:

- Washington Park Garage — two‑minute walk
- 3CDC’s Vine & 15th open‑air lot — three minutes
- Mercer Commons Garage — four minutes

Republic Street itself is permit‑only, so steer guests to garages in your invite. That clarity improves arrivals—and your mood—on show day.

## A space with a story, not a theme

The design lineage is real. Somerhaus is the sister space to [Somerset](https://somersetcincy.com/), the indoor/outdoor cocktail garden built from eight shipping containers and global finds. Inside Somerhaus you'll spot a 200‑year‑old Japanese fishing boat hung in the rafters and village gates from India—objects with history, not just props. In other words, the environment carries conversation on its own. Browse the [photo gallery](https://somerhaus.space/venue-details/photo-gallery/) to see these details up close.

## The sister venue for smaller gatherings

One block west at 139 E McMicken Ave, [Somerset](https://somersetcincy.com/) offers a greenhouse Conservatory bar, library Lounge (20–45 guests), and garden nooks for intimate gatherings. If you need a rehearsal dinner spot, after-party venue, or cocktail-focused celebration for under 50 guests, Somerset is the natural pairing—same design sensibility, different scale.

## If you're planning here, a workable game plan

1. **Tour & sketch.** Walk the room, check the light, and pick the layout that matches your guest flow.
2. **Lock the backbone.** Book the package, choose the bar tier, and confirm your caterer. Decide early where to stage photos and how you’ll use the TVs or projector.
3. **Simplify the last 5%.** Use the coordinator for timeline and tech. Keep décor focused—greenery, a clean ceremony frame, and color‑washed LEDs do more than a van of props.
